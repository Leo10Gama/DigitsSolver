# Digits Solver

Recently, the New York Times released a beta version of a new game they dubbed [Digits](https://www.nytimes.com/games/digits). It plays similarly to Wordle, but involves performing various operations on numbers to reach a target number.

Being the computer scientist I am, I decided to take a shot at writing a program to solve this game.
